# DiscordJSExample
A basic discord js example of slash commands
Basically this bot contains an example command template for the slash commands, as well as basic essentials like a command refresher script. 

Setup:
1. change the bot token (starting with MTA) in config.json and deploy-commands.js with your own bot token
2. change the client id in config.json to your own
3. run deploy-commands.js to register the commands to your bot
4. run index.js to start the bot (:



Commands can be duplicated in the folder, just run deploy-commands.js afterwards
