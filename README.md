# DiscordJSExample
A basic discord js example of slash commands
Basically this bot contains an example command template for the slash commands, as well as basic essentials like a command refresher script. 

if you need help, message: I will get tableflipped #0421 on discord
IMPORTANT: you can duplicate the command template file inside the folder for more commands, just run deploy-commands.js after to update the bot commands on discord
